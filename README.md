Classification problem in Kaggle: prediction of heart disease status

This data set was downloaded from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

I would like to use this dataset to build some machine learning model to predict whether a person has heart disease ("0" or "1" in the target field).

There are three Jupyter Notebook files:
1. Heart - Preprocess (visualization and preprocessing of the inputs based on the data type and basic understanding);
2. Heart - Logistic Regression (Use the logistic regression to predict the results);

2a. Heart - Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest (Use the logistic regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest to predict the results)
3. Heart - Deep Learning (Use neural network for prediction).
